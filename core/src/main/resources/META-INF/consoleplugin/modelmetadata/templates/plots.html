        <h2>Writing expressions</h2>
        An expression filters the list of resource models. It allows finding models with specific performance characteristics. For instance,
        in order to find resource models who's average mapping duration is higher than the average mapping duration of all resource models, type
        <span class="expressionExample">totalTime > average(totalTime)</span>. You can also employ sub clauses and arithmetic expressions. For instance,
        in order to find models that are responsible for more than 5% of the entire mapping time, write <span class="expressionExample">totalTime > entire(totalTime) * 0.05</span>
        <h2>The model visualization</h2>
        The models are ordered by their total mapping time (totalTime). Each graph exhibits the following dimensions;
        <table>
            <tbody>
                <tr><th>Instantiations</th><td>The number of times the model was instantiated</td></tr>
                <tr><th>Subsequent mappings</th><td>The total number of resource to model mappings initiated by a resource model, i.e. the subsequently used resource models.</td></tr>
                <tr><th>&#x00D8; duration</th><td>The average duration of one resource to model mapping for this type</td></tr>
                <tr><th>median</th><td>The median duration of one resource to model mapping for this type</td></tr>
                <tr><th>Lazy fields</th><td>The number of lazy fields (Optional fields or lazy-loading collections) of this resource model</td></tr>
                <tr><th>Greedy fields</th><td>The number of non-lazy fields (neither Optional nor lazy-loading collection) of this resource model</td></tr>
                <tr><th>Greedy fields</th><td>The number of non-lazy fields (neither Optional nor lazy-loading collection) of this resource model</td></tr>
                <tr><th>Total time</th><td>The total time spend mapping this model</td></tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
