        Less is better. Models in the upper right corner of this plot combine frequent instantiations (usage) with a high number of subsequent mappings, i.e.
        further resource models mapped to the model. The size of the circle corresponds to the average execution time of a single mapping.
        Models with frequent instantiations, a lot of mappings and a high average mapping time are the most costly - and potential candidates for refactorings, e.g. for breaking up the model into
        smaller models representing the various aspects of the original model.

        Less is better. This frequency table shows the distribution of the mapping times, grouped in intervals. Usually, the mapping times should be relatively low and
        quite constant, i.e. only appear in 1-6 neighboring intervals. If you experience long mapping time occurrences (on the far right), investigating the issues leading to these
        exceptional mapping times is highly recommended.
