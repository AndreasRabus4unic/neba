In this bundle, an explicit export of the package "io.neba.core.tags" was added.
This package is usually provided and exported by the NEBA core fragment bundle, but is ignored due to the Apache Felix issue
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FELIX-3239. In addition, the symbolic name is modified to reflect that this
is a NEBA-specific version of this bundle. Also, the fix for https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=403628
is contained in this bundle.
