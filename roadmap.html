    <h2>Technical roadmap</h2>

    <p>See also <a href="https://github.com/unic/neba/issues?q=is%3Aopen+milestone%3ARoadmap+label%3Aenhancement+">open enhancements in the roadmap milestone</a>.</p>

    <h3>Adaptation of Sling features added to AEM 6.x +</h3>
    <p>
        The latest Sling versions feature highly valuable additions in the area of <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SLING/Multitenancy+Support">multi-tenancy</a>,
        and <a href="https://bdelacretaz.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/artyom-thesis.pdf">continuous deployment</a> and scalability,
        most prominently through the transition to <a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/index.html">jackrabbit-oak</a>.
        The <a href="https://github.com/unic/neba/milestones/Sling@AEM6.x">NEBA API shall feature first-class support for these new concepts</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Transition to Java 8+</h3>
    <p>
        For reasons of our commitment to long-term support, NEBA supports AEM 5.3.x to AEM 6.1.x based deployments. However, AEM 5.3 - AEM 5.6. will slowly disappear
        from the market in the foreseeable future. This makes possible the transition from supporting JDK 1.6x+ to supporting JDK 1.8x, leveraging the new features contained therein
    </p>

    <h3>Transition to Spring 4+</h3>
    <p>
        Along with the transition to Java 8+, we strive to transition to Spring 4 to benefit from <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/new-in-4.0.html">first-class support for web technologies</a> such as
        web sockets, SockJS and STOMP as well as extended Support for RESTful controllers. We suspect that this transition
        will have little to no impact on legacy applications running on Spring 3.2.x, as almost all of the core features and APIs remain supported
        in Spring 4.

    <h2>Community roadmap</h2>
    <p>See also <a href="https://github.com/unic/neba/issues?q=is%3Aopen+milestone%3ARoadmap+label%3Adocumentation+">open items in the roadmap milestone</a>.</p>

    <h3>Continued community growth</h3>
    <p>
        NEBA is developed by Unic since 2009. As such, it has widespread use for medium to large-scale projects for car manufacturers, financial industry, government and luxury industry.
        We now aim to see further projects - including projects solely using Apache Sling - benefit from the mature feature stack.
        <br />
        We thus strive to continuously extend our base of contributors and interested engineers. For this purpose, NEBA is presented at conferences such as the <a href="http://adapt.to/2015/en.html">.adaptTo()</a>
        and the <a href="http://www.connectcon.ch/2014/en.html">Connect</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Extension of documentation</h3>
    <p>
        To further improve the documentation, more examples - e.g. best practices and patterns, as well as screen casts shall be added to the neba.io Site in 2015.
