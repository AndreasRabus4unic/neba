            <p>If I where to name the most significant characteristics of enterprise content management, I would choose an excessive amount of features, accompanied by
            an impressive number of third-party systems to integrate. Top this of with the fact that such projects tend to be long-running, typical challenges arise: The architecture
            is under constant pressure, having to maintain a great degree of modularity in order to keep our software running across the boundaries of product version
            and adapt to frequent changes.</p>

            <blockquote><p>NEBA is a mature project. It is active and productive since three years. It runs in all of our projects, from small to very, very large.</p></blockquote>

            <p>Key to a decent modularization is to build systems out of modules that have focus - doing one thing right at a time and collaborating with one another
            in a controlled manner. While a generic solution pattern for this is provided by OSGi, the presence of complex or simply tedious system-level concerns
            in domain-specific implementation is difficult to overcome, and often leads to project-specific solutions that are hard to change and couple things that should be separate.</p>

            <p>However, the majority of system-level concerns are usually already solved - in elegant ways - by existing, open source frameworks. Most prominently, the
            Spring Framework provides a simple, yet scalable way to re-use mature solution patterns for most of our concerns.</p>

            <p>What was needed, however, was a clean integration with Sling, an integration that would stick to the open core philosophy of the product, leverage
            the architecture defined by OSGi and Sling while being simple, not to say beautiful to use.</p>

            <p>NEBA is this missing part. It integrates Spring into Sling and provides additional, generic solution patterns for Sling - with the use of a handful of well-documented, semantic annotations.</p>

            <p>NEBA's continued success and the rising demand amongst both our customers and engineers to use it free of constraints has motivated us to open source it - we think it is a valuable
            contribution to building great applications with Sling - and we'd like to share it.</p>
