    <p>NEBA welcomes contribution of any form at any time. If you'd like to a report an issue or
    request a feature or change, just <a href="https://github.com/unic/neba/issues">created an issue</a> - a responsible
    committer will get to it.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Contributing source code</h2>
    <p>
        If you would like to contribute code, we're looking forward to your <a href="https://github.com/unic/neba/pulls">pull request</a>.
        Note: The primary development branch is "develop" (we use <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">gitflow</a>), so you might want to develop against that.</p>
    <p>
        Before we can integrate your change, we need you to sign the <a href="assets/contributing/CLA-indiv.pdf">individual contributor license agreement</a>
        and the <a href="assets/contributing/CLA-corporate.pdf">corporate license agreement</a>, if you contribute as a member of an organization. This
        is crucial to keep our stuff IP-clean - thank you!

    <h2 class="title">Becoming a committer</h2>
    <p>
    If you have knowledge of both Spring and Sling and would like to join, you are more than welcome
    as a committer. Usually, you start of by making a couple of pull requests to show your expertise - than, the
    existing committers will vote on the decision.
